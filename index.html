              I’ve been here for centuries - staring at my plain white walls, while she sings to me her opinions and complaints. And in the midst of my daze, when she finally sees my silence, she shifts her songs to mockery.
              To think that she is the rational, mature and insightful one - now she has seen things that i have not - yes she has seen things i should have seen, but she just.
              “Do this, do that, I think, you should, they are, you are, shut up, don’t worry, let me, they don’t, you don’t” endless, endless babbling, commands and controlling songs.
              I’ve been here for centuries - staring at my plain white walls. And when is tomorrow, I don't know, for I stopped longing for it. What happened yesterday I don't remember for she took that memory from me.
              I kindly begged her to show me a day from the past, and I succumbed, I stumbled and fell, I laid on my floor, wasted and completely miserable. Not that I ever was not miserable, but that moment I wanted to perish. For if I go, so does she.
              I’ve been here for centuries - walking to school, with a cigarette in my right hand, with her yelling or singing pointless lullabies in my right ear. And when I'm completely alone, she pushes me aside, and I'm watching myself walk. And then someone I know walks up to me and I fight for control, because she will be silent, she will be distant, she will ignore or say vacant words with no meaning and that is not who I strive to be.
              I’ve been here for centuries - staring at her, the mirror has never seen me before, nor the reflection in the water, nor any camera has ever captured me.
              I’ve been here for centuries - shut up she said, and I said you shut up, my body, my mind, my control, BUT im the more rational one, im the one you want to be, no I then said no, no, no, no, no! I am me, only me, you are NOT real, you are my stupid imagination trying to be edgy, and then she got mad, really really mad, she yelled at me, and i saw my parents in front of me, hands raised, and i prepared for pain, but realised they were not there, just me and her, she did it on purpose! She did it on purpose! She remembers things I don't, and when she wants me down, she gives them to me! What evil, what mean! How could my own detached self be so mean yet so insightful? Everyone knows im naive and foolish, everyone knows im dumber than a door, everyone knows i lack perspective and skill in life, so why is my detached self (which i confused to be some sort of psychosis) why is she so mature in her own way, why is she so knowledgeable in what is and what is not. She knows so much that it no longer seems important to her, and now she just mocks me and withholds memories that I probably don’t want.
              My confusion makes me wanna scream, what are you? WHO are you? Please leave me alone, this endless mockery makes me go insane, yet i don’t wanna get rid of the comfort she provides me, the way she takes away the loneliness, the way she consults me in my life choices.
              Wouldn’t getting rid of her, get rid of me

              I really love my parents, they gave me life, raised me.
              But that's what i hate them for.  
              I never really saw fault in what they did, i thought everyone was treated that way.  
              I wondered why i wasn't allowed to hit the other children in kindergarten, i wondered why i couldn't touch other kids in kindergarten, i wondered why i couldn't call them names.  
              Why could mama and papa do that when i couldn't?  
              I always went past the police with caution even though i did nothing wrong, but my mama always told me to roll my sleeves down, she said the police might see my blue marks, i felt guilty for having them.  
              I hated to see my parents fight, because it was always my fault.  
              My papa was going to kill my mama, he had her chokehold and yelled "Я УБЬЮ ТЕБЯ" (I will kill you).  
              It was my fault though, then he grabbed me and did things to me that i don't quite remember, but i deserved it.  
              I was really scared, when i was standing in the stairwell, and my mama wouldn't let me inside, it was really cold. My neighbour came up, his eyes were red, and he smelled kinda funny, i don't think he saw me.  
              I cried a lot when my papa went outside to smoke, i thought he had left us, and then he'd yell at me for crying, for being afraid to lose him, it was my fault again.  
              I was misbehaving, why did i do that, i love my parents, i would always listen to them, maybe it was a miscommunication? But i deserved punishment, so i stared at the corner for a few hours.  
              My mama was brushing my hair, she was rough with it, but i was a mess, stupid i started crying and she hit me with the brush.  
              I was playing a game with my papa and i cheated, he hit me on the head.  
              I accidentally stepped on my mamas feet and she hit me in my stomach.  
              I told my papa my own opinion and he hit me on the head.  
              My mama once spilled a glass of wine, while i was doodling, and i started apologising and crying, because it was my fault.  
              My sister once didn't want to eat, i asked why, questions were not okay.  
              I once came home either crying or mad, i was hit and yelled at, but it was my fault, we had to be happy. We had to be positive, we had to be.<br>
              *1. Do not show any negative emotion.*<br>
              *2. Do not have own opinions.*<br>
              *3. Do not talk again.*<br>  
              *4. Do not comment.*<br>  
              *5. Do everything they demand, no matter how unpleasant.*<br>  
              *6. Ignore the crying.*<br>  
              I was always scared of the dark, but even then they locked my door, and it was so so dark, it was brighter when i closed my eyes, and imagined them embracing me, with nothing but love.  
              Then my papa left, i always wondered why, he said he'd return, but weeks went by and i didn't see him, i really missed him, i was really lonely.  
              But my mama stopped hitting me, she still locked me out and yelled at me, and called me names, but thats my fault. And i still love her.  
              Then i saw my papa again, though i had to come to him, he didn't hit me either! but he was still mad at me for very small things, and he drank quite many glasses of whiskey! but that's on me. And i still love him.  
              Im their child.  
              Cursed with forgivness.

              Time did not exist, at least I wasn't thinking of it. And tomorrow was just another question I had no answer to. The crashing waves, the distant lights of apartments on the other side of the bridge that lead to the beach, the breeze, and my two best friends, that was all I needed to forget time, to forget tomorrow and yesterday.
              My two best friends never spoke, not a single word have i ever heard, but even then, they make me feel good, they make me forget yesterday and tomorrow, they give me confidence, they give me a rush, or a calm, depending on where we are.
              The beach wasn’t anything particularly special to me, nor for my friends, but we especially liked to hang out here. Burning letters of forgotten loved ones, mourning a non-existent alternate reality, reflecting on yesterday, and predicting tomorrow.
              Being there at dark was best, my friends are shy, not accepted by society as much. They’re only really looked upon at festive times, but otherwise people look down on us. But I don't care, we three go against the world.
              People have tried keeping us apart, telling me dirty lies about them, but I don't care, they are my best friends. I will love them no matter what, no matter how much they may hurt me, I love them. I sit here on the cold sand, telling them my gratitude for them, and in return I get nothing but silence. Maybe a spark flies by, maybe a warmth washes over me.
              But right now, this moment, not yesterday, not tomorrow, not the past, not the future. But right now, us three, the beach, stars, crashing waves. Perfect, I get to really feel, and despite it I live. I really get to understand that I am nothing in this world, and despite it I exist.

              I lay twitching, my thoughts run astray, everyone sounds like flies, everyone makes my blood boil. I can physically feel my blood, my head is throbbing, my lungs are on fire and everything seems unbearable. What did I do to myself. The realisation of how far it went, how i went too far, it wasn't supposed to be like that. I didn’t think that one would turn into a second, then a third and a fourth, and then for the count to disappear. Things were dark, but with them it was just a little lighter, just bearable enough, just enough to keep walking. And now I'm unable to do anything really, just sit and wait, suffer through it, feel my body punishing me for not keeping up.
              It was worse before though, I'd lay on the floor in pain, feeling like someone was pulling at my insides, the nausea, the heaviness, the inability to sleep, I felt like I was being punished (I was).
              To attend functions like this was even worse, the anxiety was grueling, tearing at me, everyone was an enemy, everyone wanted me dead. Thoughts were impossible to decode, nothing made sense, everything was in a fog, and I was lost. But no matter what state I was in, the pain would follow me. It was there before I went too far, it was there during, and after. Nothing I did helped, nothing I did freed me from it. It took my memories away for just a moment, but the feelings they gave me remained, multiplied. I managed to convince myself for a while that it was nothing serious, I just loved partying, I kept saying that, I kept convincing myself. I stopped coming with excuses when I was half down the toilet, feeling like my insides wanted out.
              But I needed it, I really really needed it, I really really really needed it.
              And even now, despite the worst being over, the pain never really left, the craving never really left, and if not this one, then another one, not that one, then a third one. My hunt for relief never really ends, and never will end, and as much as it will destroy me, ruin me, the price for a moment of solace is expensive.

              The word “day” has lost its meaning, there is no yesterday, today or tomorrow, it has melted into one big mess, a mess that I am drowning in. Time has lost its worth, clocks are useless, countdowns don't matter, and numbers are empty symbols. No matter the circumstance, it's all the same, grey and boring, all I ever hear is static, every word, every noise is bathed in static, no sentence makes sense, no voice is recognisable, no face is its own.
              Smells, sounds, colors, visuals have become shifted, different, eerie. Reality is not quite Itself. Whenever I walk, whenever I talk, it is NOT my actions, that is not who I am, I am not like that, my previous versions are covering what i am, my previous versions are betraying me. But truly there are no “previous” versions, it's all just me with an internal conflict I cannot resolve despite my endless efforts.
              I walk on a thin line between the living and the dead, for what is a reason for living is an excellent reason for dying.
              My face isn't mine, it has never been, my body isn't mine, never been.
              I never chose this life, my choice has never been mine, for we never truly own anything, not even words. I don't know what is going on, my mind isn't really mine, my thought are not connected, free and worthless, reflecting in my writing, and now im on a lot of glases of bubbles and i cant really think normalt, and i dont know what tk write and forgot everytbint.

              From the sickening dread to the delusional high, a constant internal fight. I let it flow, I might do something unacceptable. Try to control it, I will destroy myself. A constant dialogue between those parts, babbling and yapping, complaining about each other.
              I walk into class, i don’t say anything, i maybe give a smile but nothing else. I sit down quietly, finishing my third energy drink, but instead of energy i get tired. I lay my head down on the table and close my eyes, things flash before my eyes, the things i’ve done, my failures, what people have done to me, how they treated me. My friends are loud and discussing things, i’d usually join in, but i have nothing to say, i don’t feel like talking. Unusual. I stand up suddenly walking out, i need a cigarette. Im back. I walk out again, i need another one. Im back, i feel like everyone is staring at me, i feel judged, they can read my every thought, they can see through my eyes, i can’t take it. I look at the sun outside, im lost, my life isn’t worth living, why am i even here. As the day ends i disappear saying nothing.
              I walk into class, singing my lungs out, i jump around, i talk with every classmate i see, asking them stupid questions. I walk to my seat, slightly jumping to the music in my ears, i suddenly remember everything, i start talking about worthless things to my friends, i move with dramatic movements as if recreating the moment, i have so many idea so many stories, they flow out of my mouth like a waterfall, nothing to stop them. I run out of class, and speak with every student, every stranger has become my friend, every enemy has become ally. I jump around, run around, my energy is overwhelming, i don’t feel well. I look at the sun outside, i feel life pumping through my veins, nothing can stop me, nothing will stop me, my life is the best one out there, i finish my cigarette. I walk in, im calm, as if i exhaled all the energy out with the smoke. I looked in the bathroom mirror, i didn’t recognise the reflection, but she was beautiful, she looked amazing, i was almost jealous, but that look in her eyes was terrifying. I walk into class again, people look oddly at me, some of them ask me if im on drugs, im slightly offended but i shrug it off and laugh, i feel amazing, i don’t think they understand! As the day ends i walk out and salute to my classmates and hop away.

              You’ve got a blessing, why can't you see that. You're able to turn a worldwide hated feeling into pleasure, why does it not amaze you? It's a power. You stumble your toe, you feel amazing. You accidentally cut yourself on something, you feel satisfied. You get hit or kicked for fun by a classmate, you want more. You have a headache, it's a gift. You have a stomach ache, it's a fest. Every signal of pain is a release of euphoria. You enjoy it, you find it amusing, and yet you are repulsed by it. You go around and show people your disgust, all while secretly enjoying it. Hypocrite. I gave you this gift, so you could embrace it and cherish it, for you needed solace from pain. And yet you reject it. Yes people are repulsed by it, people don't see how pain could ever be good, but when pain is all you ever feel, you adapt. In a way it is tragic, yet it's beautiful how even the destructive can become the calm. I shielded you for years, preventing you from pain, but it was time to figure it out yourself, and I gave you that power, that adaptation. The pain wasn't that bad no more, Was it?
Your parent's hits felt milder, more tolerable, the slaps felt like challenges you were winning, everything was survivable.
In kindergarden you used to fall a lot, you laughed instead of crying like your peers. You broke your finger, you didn't cry from the pain, but the shock, you were a hypochondriac, truly a dangerous combination. I remember every single second of your life, I know you better than you, so don't you dare say no to me. Don't you dare reject, for I know what's better for you. I'm the mother you never had, i'm the father you never had, i'm the sibling you never had, i'm the friend you never had, i'm the mentor you never had, i am you, that you never had.

              I'm a mortal and a goddess. My class and my peers are forced to follow me. Yesterday I walked with pride, every reflection was not mine, never was. But the reflection was beautiful, it showed a true goddess. Her diamond blue eyes shone like a thousand stars, and her words were like a waterfall with no filter or border. She had the energy of a dying sun, she didn't care if people didn't meet eye to eye with her, she needed no one's confidence but her own. I wish I was her. I watched as she stared at the sun outside with a cigarette in her right hand. I could feel her feelings, they were exploding in a thousand colors, every single one so bright and promising. She spoke with every stranger and enemy as if they were now friends and allies, she did things far from rationality, but the beauty in that chaos was fueling. At home she sang loudly and played her guitar, as if a million people were watching and cheering. She sat on the bus with her new friends (old people) talking and talking about her amazing life. She was the happiest person I have ever seen. She spoke as if she could hold an endless amount of thoughts, and the look of excitement in her eyes was stuck in the reflection.
Now night had befallen, but she knew there were many things to do, she felt life racing through her veins, there was no time to sleep, there was no need for it.
Now the reflection of that goddess followed me for long, and I enjoyed watching her be. But tomorrow she wasn't much of a goddess any more. Tomorrow she was a mortal, I watched the reflection, but she was so ugly, filthy and disgusting. Her diamond blue eyes, now shallow and grey. She looked so small and fragile, her face stained from tears. She didn't walk with pride and confidence, she avoided all possible interactions. Now every ally and friend, enemy and stranger. She looked as if she never knew sleep, yet she slept like a rock. Not really present but still there, I watched her stare at the sun with a cigarette in her hand. I could feel her feelings and I wish I couldn't, the dread, the misery, she wanted to die! Walking between people felt like torture, every eye, every word, felt like judgement and pain. She didn't want to be seen, and yet she tried her best to act as a goddess, but inside she would always fail, pathetic.
Now alone, she'd do nothing but lay in her bed, sleep, weeping, and talking to someone who wasn't really there. A part of her knew that she would become a goddess soon again.
When we finally met eye to eye in the reflection, I saw that she was no goddess or mortal, she was me.

              I can’t exactly say how long i’ve been walking here. I can’t exactly say how long i’ve been sitting here. I can’t exactly say how long i’ve been staring. I can’t exactly say how long i’ve been talking. I can’t exactly say how long ago i disappeared, after all she knows the exact strings to pull. The sun was shining up high, the sky was blue, a perfect scenario, i too had nothing to complain about as i was walking. I automatically out of habit lit up a cigarette. Things were well, nothing to mourn. My arm moved on it’s own, forcing me to take a drag of my cigarette, i realised how much i hated smoking, and the moment i thought so “But you need it”. 
I looked at the pavement under me, i watched my shadow move along me. “You need those, they’re not healthy but its your medicine” My legs started walking on their own, my vision was foggy, in a daze, watching the pavement, the tiles move away as my body walked. “Let me carry you” I felt paralyzed, i was fighting for control in my own body, but i was so exhausted, and i let go. The music in my ears was loud, nothing outside was acknowledged, i wasn’t there, but i watched the tiles move and shift, while she walked me.
My head moved up and i saw a few of my distant friends, panic set it, i fought for control, i could not let her meet them directly, no, no, no, no.
They approached, and my struggling and desperation caught us in a middle, i vaguely greeted them, out of character. They started talking to me, asking me, explaining to me, but my voice was paralysed and we kept pulling back and forth on who talked, so all that came out was vague answers that should have stopped the conversation, i cringed inside when i heard my own words. Finally they left and i let go again, i don’t know why she was so stubborn on having me today, why today? Why now? 
I entered my class silently, my friend jumping in her face asking me if i wanted to hear what happened, “no” She didn’t like my friend at all, she walked past her, and then a classmate asked if i wanted to see what my friend did to the window, again “no” she kept walking, sat down at the window, and we stared out the window for what felt like ages, loud music, dazed and not really present, i was paralyzed. I acknowledged her, i apologised, i understood, and she let me go.
I stood up, feeling alive again, i walked to my friends at the other side of the class, and asked what happened, i found my other friend and listened to her story, i was back, and everyone just thought i was tired. She should never meet any of my friends.

              Something was not right, but at the same time everything was at it’s place. All numbers, all letters and symbols were connected, i saw the lines between them, their connection, the way they dance in our everyday lives, i saw the beauty in it. I tried explaining it to my peers, but they couldn’t see it - yes some understood the theory in it, some could understand how they were connected, but that wasn’t enough, what i saw wasn’t just connection, it was beauty, it was meaning, that, that they could not comprehend. Now everywhere i went, every building, every person, every words i said, every word i heard, they were all just numbers and connections. Despite the amazement it soon backstabbed me, nothing was real, nothing was true, nothing had its soul, nothing had its own life, everything was numbers, everything was false, everything was just a program. Reality was slipping away, nobody saw it, and i tried hard to hide it. But every eye, every glance was a threat, i wanted to hide, i wanted to be invisible, i wanted to run, but i knew i had to hold composure, i had to stay. Every word that slipped from people made my blood boil for no reason at all, i felt disgusting, i felt feral. I couldn’t look in the mirror no more, it wasn’t me looking back, it just wasn’t me. Ghosts were mocking me, calling my name and knocking, it was terrifying, no, it was annoying.
The sky was purple, filled with stars, it was quite beautiful, but my friend couldn’t see it, couldn’t see the beauty, couldn’t understand it. The skulls on the building, i knew it was just a mural, i knew it was just art, but they were yelling at me, screaming at me, that i would die, that death was after me, that my time was close to an end, i was terrified. I tried to ignore their yelling but they were so loud, the screeching the screaming, i couldn’t take it.
Reality wasn’t really here no more, everytime i walked i stumbled on glitches on the ground, everytime i spoke i couldn’t hear myself, everytime i slept, shadows were staring at me. But i had her, she would tell me what was happening, she would tell me whenever it was real or not, she guided me through that nightmare, of losing reality, she walked me through it, made me familiar with it. I wander through dreams and nightmare as if reality, and then im left to hope that reality comes back. Atleast she is with me all the way.
I applaud myself for hiding it so well. So does she.

              I know I messed up, I had the chance and I spoiled it. I discovered what not-being-me felt like, and I fell in love, to the point where it went too far and I'm never me again. I wish they never showed me, I wish they never let me, but it is all on my hands, my dirty, filthy hands, bathed in blood and guilt. It was bound to happen, it runs in my blood. The days where i watched the tides shift and sway, i knew and i accepted that i was bound to become what i am today, i watched them shift and sway as myself, i watched the sand and the shells knowing that i was not special, i was not my own, i was just as much a part of all as anything else. I was and I am just a reflection, a memory of what one day won't be, of what one day will be nothing but the ash of someone who once used to be. My existence is merely a memory already lived, a life already done, and a reality already disintegrated. My friends and my family merely writers of my book, me too a writer of theirs. A current which never ends, a constant with infinite numbers, a force that never ends, which runs all of our lives, leaving some behind and birthing new. All the things which gave so much sorrow, just unfortune caught under the shoe, all the pain, just written in blood, and someday it will mean nothing. My name forgotten, my eyes never seen and my words carved into papers long burned. The future has left us behind and the past will hold us tight, without a word to the present. I am just as much as the others, i am just as much as everything breathing, just as much as what Is.

              She made herself seem different, she made herself seem like a completely other person. she spoke to me as if another, she scolded me as if another, she watched me as if another. And for a moment I believed she was another. I fully saw her as another, as her own person, her own mind and words, her own thoughts and opinions. But when I looked in the mirror all I saw was me. All along she was me, all along she was my thoughts, all along she was my feelings, all along she was myself scolding me, it was me watching me, it was me. For so long everything has been so distant, every face, every word and every action, just a dream, an imagination of what could be, so far away, so unrealistic that even my own face and my own thoughts and my own feelings have never felt like my own. For even I don't feel real, I'm stuck in a body that’s not mine, forced to follow its waltz, forced to feel its feelings. And I bonded with one who was just me, I spoke with one who was just me, with one who was just a reflection.
I am her, she is me.

              I don't know how I ended up there, I don't remember why I was there, I didn't remember who I was, my past erased, and my present non-existent. I only knew that the angels were walking me through my life, showing me what was and what could have been, judging me. Was I going to hell for my sins, or to heaven for my virtues? Time was slipping, morning and evening were the same, day and night had no difference. Every memory melted together, my past and future the same. My soul had no body, I was nothing, I was just air. Every talking thing was a threat, no matter how much i knew the person, no matter how much i cared for them, they wanted me dead, they were after me, they were plotting against me. Everything had a connection, everything was foreshadowing. Surroundings changed with words, and reality was bending against my will. I was a rat in a maze, every wall that I knocked down was just a wall that I'd replace, I was stuck in the same scenes over and over and over again, and I seemingly would never get out. Something was talking to me, I don't know who, or where, or why, but they were whispering. Everything felt like a cruel joke, a mockery of what my life had been reduced to. Every face I knew became stranger, I saw beneath their faces and emotions, I saw their intentions, I could smell it. Fear, lust, worry and excitement was all that I could smell in the crowd, it was all that they felt. I didn’t know what I felt, because I was everything and nothing at the same time, I had reached some kind of cosmic level of being. And yet I tried my best to conceal my own reality and being slipping away. The shadows followed me, mocked me as I tried to walk home in the freezing weather, every corner, every bush had its own shadow staring at me, even my own shadow was threatening, but I kept walking, I kept walking, I kept walking. And even in my own bed I felt unsafe, for dream and reality were really not so different in the moment, every dream I had could just as much be reality, and I would never really know.
None of this was ever real, yet it was real in every single sense of the word.
I had my wallpapers peeled, I was judged by the divine, I was a constant, I was everything and nothing, I was and was not, I was thrown through a thousand realities in the span of a second, each of them as terrible as the last, and none of them better. Every person just another version of me, I was staring into a broken mirror, watching hundreds of shattered pieces of me. I saw the roots of evil, I saw the birth of good, I saw how there was no difference, only survival. I saw every core of every person. I saw time itself; it is thought that time is linear and never ending, yet I saw it shift and flow, back and forth, up and down, round and round, it went where it wanted to, and it had no mercy, not even for me, who had broken the boundaries of reality.
